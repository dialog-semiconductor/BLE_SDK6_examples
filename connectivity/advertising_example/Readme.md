# DA14585/DA14586/DA14531 - Changing advertising methods using GPIO button interrupt or timer callbacks

![Banner](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/lpccs-docs.renesas.com/metadata/BLE_SDK6_examples/connectivity/advertising_example/banner.svg?v=1)


## Example description

This example shows how to:
- Use a button to switch between advertising methods.
- Sleep or wake up after pressing a button for 3 seconds.
- Use timer callbacks to switch between advertising methods. 
- Use timer callbacks to go to sleep or wake up.

The expected result of the example can be verified by:
- Connecting a serial terminal on the work station to the MB (Mother Board) using UART.
- The status of the LED.

### __Software configuration__

  - This example was built on SDK 6.0.14 will be compatible with latest versions.

This example requires:
	
- [SDK latest version](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/da14531_sdk_latest).
- Keil5.
- __SEGGERâ€™s J-Link__ tools should be downloaded and installed.
- Serial Terminal software. For example Tera Term or PuTTY.

## How to run the example

### Setup

For the initial setup of the project that involves linking the SDK to this SW example, please follow the Readme [here](../../Readme.md).

1. Start Keil using the `changing_advertising.uvprojx` Keil project file.

2. Expand the dialog shown in the red box in the image below.

3. Select your device: DA14531, DA14586 or DA14585.
		
   ![Select_Device](assets/Select_Device.png)

4. Open a serial terminal on the work station using for example Tera Term/PuTTY with the following parameters:
	```
	- baud rate: 115200
	- data: 8 bits
	- stop: 1 bit
	- parity: None
	- flow  control: none
	```

5. Compile (F7) and launch (ctrl + F5) the example.\


## GPIO identification 
Make sure to read the correct identification according to your mother board and daughter board.

### DA14585/DA14586 GPIO identification with DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `D5` and the color is `orange`.
2. Identify button:
	- `SW3` is used as button in this example

### DA14531 GPIO identification with DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `D5` and the color is `orange`.
2. Identify button:
	- `SW2` is used as button in this example

### DA14585/DA14586 GPIO identification with Basic Dev Kit
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `USR` and the color is `green`.
2. Identify button:
	- The button connected (by the user) to P1_1 on J4

## Expected Results button example
- The changing advertising example is now running. 
- Make sure that the ADV_EXAMPLE and the ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE are both defined defined in _user_config.h_.
- Make sure *CFG_PRINTF*  is defined if UART messages are desired.
- The LED status is toggle when the advertising is started. The LED state will toggle between advertising changes and will remain off during permanent sleep periods. 
- The image below describes the behavior.

## Expected Results timer example
- The changing advertising example is now running.
- Make sure ADV_EXAMPLE is defined in _user_config.h_ (if only the ADV_EXAMPLE definition is enabled the demo will change the advertising state via timer).
- Make sure that ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE is __not__ defined.
- Make sure *CFG_PRINTF*  is defined if UART messages are desired.
- The LED status is toggle when the advertising is started. The LED is set inactive when the system is going to sleep. 
- The image below describes the behavior.

## Optional software configurations

 - The following parameters can be configured in _user_barebone.h_
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the undirected advertising interval.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the non-connectible advertising interval.
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the undirected advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the non-connectible advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *SLEEP_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the sleep duration in the timer based example.

## About this example
Starting point for this example is the BLE barebone project from SDK6. This provides the right framework for the advertising events used in this example.

- Comparing to BLE barebone project from SDK6 some changes were made to _user_barebone.c_, these changes can be easily traced as they are marked with the ADV_EXAMPLE flag.
- Minor changes were made to the _user_peripheral_setup_ files to accommodate the button functionality and LED indication.
- The user_callback_config.h has been slightly modified. Callback is added for non-connectible advertising.
- The user_button.h and user_button.c were added. These files accommodate the button functionality used in this example.

## Troubleshooting
- Please check that the steps according to your daughter board (DA14531, DA14585 or DA14586) and mother board (basic dev kit or DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard) are followed correctly.

- Try a different USB1 cable.

- Try different jumper wire, if used.

- If none of the steps described above help, please check the user manual according to your development kit.
