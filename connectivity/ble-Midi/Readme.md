## HW and SW configuration

- **Hardware configuration**

- This example runs on the DA14531 and DA14585/586 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
- The DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard with jumper setting for SPI flash programming. The user manuals for the development kits can be found [Here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/da14531-development-kit-pro) for the DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard.
