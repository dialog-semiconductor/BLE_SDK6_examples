## Example description

Sample software application to interface Dialog DA14585/586 BLE SoC's with mCube MC36xx (MC3672/35) accelerometers.

This DA14585 example shows how to communicate with a mCube accelerometer sensor over I2C interface. The sensor data gets sent over BLE with a notification when connected to a mobile application. Features in this example includes the implementation code for sensor sniff mode for low-power application and FIFO as sensor buffer.


## HW and SW configuration

### Hardware configuration

The current example focuses on the implementation of Accel connected via I2C and sending sensor data over BLE notifications using the DA14585 & MC3672. For SPI interface implementation refer to [MC3672 Quick Start Guide](https://mcubemems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MC3672-Quick-Start-Guide-APS-045-0017v1.2.pdf) which demos the MC3672 Arduino implementation or [mCube-MC36XX-Programming Guide](https://github.com/mcubemems/Accelerometer_mc36xx_mcu_driver/blob/master/MC36XX_MCU_3.1.0/mCube%20-%20MC36XX%20-%20Programming%20Guide%20%20v1.1.1.pdf) for general platforms.

**Note:** Both the SPI and I2C interfaces cannot be active at the same time as the clock (SCK) and data (SDA) are shared between the two protocols.

- This SW example runs on The [DA14585/DA14586](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/connectivity/bluetooth-low-energy/smartbond-da14585-and-da14586) Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
- The Basic or Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
- Connect the SCL pin of the [EV3672A](https://mcubemems.com/product/mc3672-3-axis-accelerometer) to pin 1-0 of the development board.
- Connect the SDA pin of the [EV3672A](https://mcubemems.com/product/mc3672-3-axis-accelerometer) to pin 1-2 of the development board.
- These pins are defined in the m_drv_interface.h file

### Software configuration

Before user starts to load this DEMO. The following software tools has to be setup.
- This example requires:
	- Keil μVision 5
	- Dialog SDK 6.0.10
	- Smartphone with a BLE scanning app (for example BLE Scanner on Android or Lightblue on IOS)
	- **SEGGER’s J-Link** tools should be downloaded and installed.


## How to run the example

The implementation of mCube accelerometer driver is described in the [mCube-MC36XX-Programming Guide](https://github.com/mcubemems/Accelerometer_mc36xx_mcu_driver/blob/master/MC36XX_MCU_3.1.0/mCube%20-%20MC36XX%20-%20Programming%20Guide%20%20v1.1.1.pdf). Customers using mCube sensors for the first time, refer to this document for understanding the driver implementation. The repository also includes the driver source code if needed.

### Compile and run

To compile and run this program, user can follow the steps below.
- Open the project mCube_mc36xx_data_notifcation in Keil μVision 5.
- Optionally, change the parameters in m_drv_mc36xx.c
- Compile and run the project
- Open the BLE scanner app and look for DLG-ACCL
- Connect to the device
- Subscribe to the notifications

- To enable the Sniff and/or FIFO modes, modify the configurations as show below. The default FIFO threshold is 5 samples but it can set to a maximum of 32 samples or just set FIFO to FIFO_FULL mode.
